# Jo Kent Photography

A website to display the work of the fictional photographer Jo Kent.

The Jo Kent Photography project is a fictional site created for the purpose of learning new things and exploring various web technologies. It is not an actual photography website, but rather a tool used to practice and experiment with different frameworks and libraries.

All imagery used has either been created by myself or sourced from UnSplash.
